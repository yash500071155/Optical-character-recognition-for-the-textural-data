This is a simple program that performs image recognition on the mnist  datasets using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. It's around 170 lines of Python and represents a very basic example of image recognition. In my tests, it gets up to 93% accuracy on mnist. It's not particularly fast, but I hope you find it easy to follow and interesting.
